						Hi, I’m Katie, a student designer and developer focused on digital
						media. I create engaging visuals and interactive content to help
						brands connect with their audience and stand out. My goal is to
						combine creativity and technology to deliver impactful digital
						experiences.

					<p>
						Currently studying Web Design and Development, I’ve developed skills
						in Adobe Creative Suite and coding languages like HTML, CSS, and
						JavaScript. My goal is to work in Web Design, Multimedia Design, and
						Branding to help create impactful digital experiences. Outside of
						school, I enjoy thrifting, watching shows and movies, reading,
						trying new restraunts and spending time with my 2 year old
						Tortoiseshell kitty.
